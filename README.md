# Friend Finder

### Remaining Issues
The logic to find the best friend match based upon the new friend entered from the form is completed in apiRouts.js as instructed.  However, I am unable to find a way to use it to pull the required information and launch the modal.  I have tried running the JQuery from the apiRoutes.js file and install the jquery npm package, returning the data from the apiRoutes.js file, creating a new function that returns the data to the survey.html, but nothing is working for me.
